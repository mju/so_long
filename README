Please use the Makefile to compile the so_long library and the test drives.
The test drives use gmp project(http://gmplib.org/).  Please install it if you want to run tests.

To use the library, you can actually just cat so_long.h and so_long.c with your source.  Please see so_long.h too see the options/switches to use.

Please report bugs to MickeyJu@gmail.com
